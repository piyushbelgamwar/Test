Perfect! Based on your answers, here’s how to modify your Drools rules:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

## Summary of Changes Made:

### **🗑️ Completely Removed:**

- **Rule “1”** - File attachment restriction for nil return
- **Rule “2_4”** - Field prevention when nil return = yes

### **✏️ Modified (removed nil return checks):**

**Pattern removed from all applicable rules:**

```java
// REMOVED THIS CONDITION:
$reP008.getDeclaration().getNilReturn().equalsIgnoreCase("no") && 
```

**Rules updated:**

- Rule “2” - Still validates “at least one row must be completed”
- Rules “2_1”, “2_2” - Mandatory field validations
- Rules “2A”, “2B”, “2C” - Name field validations
- Rules “2E”, “2I” - DOB and job position validations
- Rules “2J_null”, “2K_null” - Risk taker and conduct rule validations
- Rules “2L”, “2M” - Breach info and disciplinary action validations

### **✅ Unchanged (no nil return logic existed):**

- Rules “2D”, “2F”, “2G”, “2H” - Identification validations
- Rules “2J_1R”, “2J_1” - Risk taker business logic and duplication
- Rules “2K_1R”, “2K_1” - Conduct rule duplication and business logic

## **Key Benefits:**

✅ **Simplified logic** - No more nil return conditions  
✅ **Unconditional validation** - All rules apply to all submissions  
✅ **Preserved functionality** - All business validations still work  
✅ **Cleaner code** - Removed unnecessary conditional checks

The rules now assume every submission requires at least one notification row and all validations apply unconditionally. Is this exactly what you needed?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
