‚úÖ Creating a Dummy FRN in the Dev Environment for Testing

Use the following step-by-step process to create and validate a dummy FRN (Firm Reference Number) in the Dev environment for internal testing purposes:

‚∏ª

üîç Step 1: Check if FRN Already Exists

Before initiating the process, confirm that the FRN is not already present in the system by querying the following backend tables:
	‚Ä¢	meta_firms
	‚Ä¢	master_firms
	‚Ä¢	regulated_firms

Use SQL or any data inspection tool to confirm the absence of the FRN (e.g., 122158). Only proceed if the FRN does not exist in any of the above tables.

‚∏ª

üöÄ Step 2: Trigger the EMR Pipeline via Jenkins (Step 1.1)
	1.	Open Jenkins.
	2.	Locate and run the EMR pipeline for Step 1.1 (the firm ingestion process).
	3.	Ensure the environment is set to dev.
	4.	This action will spin up an EMR cluster on AWS to begin processing the firm data.

‚∏ª

üßæ Step 3: Upload the FRN JSON File to S3
	1.	Prepare a JSON file containing dummy FRN data.
	2.	Upload it to the following S3 path:
s3://dcp-dev-system-batch-s3/firm_permission/data/
	3.	Once uploaded, it will automatically trigger Step 1.1 for ingestion.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Step 4: Initial Verification in dcp-internal
	1.	Open https://dev-internal.regdata.fca.org.uk.
	2.	Navigate via:
	‚Ä¢	Firm & User Administration ‚Üí Firm Administration ‚Üí Firm Profile
	‚Ä¢	Or use Search Firm by entering the FRN (e.g., 122158).
	3.	‚úÖ Important: After Step 1.1 runs successfully, you will be able to search and find the firm, but:
	‚Ä¢	The Firm Profile will appear empty ‚Äî no characteristics or values will be shown at this point.
	‚Ä¢	This is expected and indicates Step 1.2 still needs to be executed.

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è Step 5: Run Step 1.2 from Jenkins and Check EMR Status
	1.	Go to Jenkins and find the pipeline job for Step 1.2 (enrichment phase).
	2.	Trigger the Step 1.2 pipeline with the correct environment (dev).
	3.	After triggering, go to the Amazon EMR console and confirm:
	‚Ä¢	The cluster/job has been initialized
	‚Ä¢	The job completes without error
	4.	Once Step 1.2 is successful:
	‚Ä¢	Return to the Firm Profile screen in dcp-internal
	‚Ä¢	You should now see:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Access to Cash ATM = true
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Appointed Reps = true
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Appointed Reps Reporting = true
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Effective Date: 31/07/1925 to 31/07/2125
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Firm Status: Enabled
