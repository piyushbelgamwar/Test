2️⃣ String Flag
	•	Use when you need named or formatted values (e.g., "25-03-2025", "beta", "A", "control")
	•	Examples:
	•	"enabled" / "disabled"
	•	"25-03-2025" for rollout date
	•	"v1" / "v2" for variant control

🔹 Step 6: Set Targeting & Default Rule
	•	You can skip targeting for now, or configure it by:
	•	User attributes (email, key, group)
	•	Segments (internal users, beta testers)
	•	Select a default variation to serve when no rule matches

🔹 Step 7: Add Required Tags

Make sure to tag the flag for traceability:

jira:REG-123, module:registration, team:identity-platform, type:release

🔹 Step 8: Save and Enable the Flag
	•	Click Save Flag
