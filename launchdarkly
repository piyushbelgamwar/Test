Great, Piyush! This new image adds even more clarity to the AI Configurations module in LaunchDarkly. Here’s an enhanced summary — with realistic use cases and developer actions 👇

⸻

🚀 LaunchDarkly – AI Configurations (Accelerate AI)

🔄 1. Iterate Prompt & Model Configs at Runtime
	•	Modify AI prompts or switch model versions (e.g., GPT-4 → Claude) on-the-fly
	•	Instant rollback supported if behavior is off-track

✅ Use Case:
Update your customer service bot’s prompt for festive season responses — rollback if CSAT drops.

⸻

📉 2. Monitor AI Metrics & Auto-Fallback
	•	Set thresholds on metrics like latency, accuracy, toxicity, etc.
	•	Automatically revert to a safe/previous model if new one underperforms

✅ Use Case:
Fallback to GPT-3.5 if GPT-4 response time exceeds 1s or violates guardrails.

⸻

🧠 3. Target Specific Audiences
	•	Deliver different prompts/models to different user segments:
	•	Free vs Paid
	•	Region-wise
	•	Power-users vs first-time users

✅ Use Case:
Use Claude for US region, Mistral for EU region due to latency or cost advantages.

⸻

⚙️ 4. Experiment for Optimization
	•	Run A/B or multivariate tests on:
	•	Prompt tone (formal vs casual)
	•	Summarization style
	•	Model vendor (e.g., OpenAI vs Cohere)

✅ Use Case:
Test 3 different prompts to find the best one for product description generation in e-commerce.

⸻

🔧 Developer Actions to Implement

Action	Tooling
Define AI flag	LaunchDarkly dashboard or SDK
Add model/prompt variations	JSON flag config with variations
Target audience	LD targeting rules (user attributes, custom tags)
Monitor metrics	Use OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, or LD custom metrics
Auto-rollback	Use flag rules with metric thresholds




Perfect, Piyush! Based on the latest images, here’s a final polished summary of LaunchDarkly’s platform modules — organized for quick recall, POCs, or even interviews 👇

⸻

	•	🎯 Targeting & Progressive Rollouts
	•	📈 Monitor performance thresholds
	•	🔁 Automated Rollbacks
	•	⚠️ Error Monitoring

🧠 Use case: Deploy a risky backend update to 5% of traffic, auto-rollback if latency > 800ms.

⸻

🤖 2. AI Configurations – “Accelerate AI”

Control AI prompts & models dynamically

	•	✨ Runtime prompt/model config
	•	📉 Auto-fallback if model underperforms
	•	🎯 Targeted AI experiences (GenAI)
	•	🧪 A/B test prompts and models

🧠 Use case: Switch between GPT and Claude via feature flag based on user region.

⸻

🧪 3. Experimentation – “Remove Barriers”

Bring A/B testing to any prompt, model, or feature

	•	🔗 Attach experiments to any flag/model
	•	📊 Analyze results with full visibility
	•	🧮 Statistical rigor built-in
	•	🏢 Warehouse-native (Snowflake, Redshift)

🧠 Use case: Test 2 checkout UIs for conversion rate and rollout the best one.

⸻

📦 4. Release Management – “Increase Developer Productivity”

Standardize and govern all releases

	•	🔄 Repeatable pipelines & workflows
	•	🧹 Auto flag cleanup lifecycle
	•	🩺 Release health insights
	•	✅ Custom roles & approval workflows

🧠 Use case: Avoid stale flags in large orgs with auto-recommendations for cleanup.

⸻

💼 Enterprise-Grade Trust

✅ Capability	💡 Highlights
Scale	35T+ flag checks/day, 26 SDKs
Security	SOC2, GDPR, ISO27001, RBAC, audit logs
Reliability	200ms rollback, multi-region, 24/7 SLAs
Integrations	CI/CD, Monitoring, Analytics ready

🧠 Used by: Atlassian, OpenAI, SAP, IBM, Databricks, Cisco, Autodesk

⸻

🔧 Developer-First Focus
	•	🛠️ 25+ Language SDKs
	•	🧪 API-first & CLI tools
	•	🔄 Seamless with modern DevOps (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, etc.)

⸻

Would you like this turned into:
	•	✅ A one-pager PDF/slide?
	•	✅ A Spring Boot POC using LaunchDarkly for AI fallback?
	•	✅ A comparison with AWS AppConfig or SSM Parameter Store?

Happy to build it next!


Thanks for the detailed screenshots, Piyush! 🙌
You’ve now captured the real working UI of LaunchDarkly’s Guarded Releases and Progressive Rollouts — so let me summarize it with clarity + context + real-world microservice example.

⸻

🎯 How LaunchDarkly Helps (Your Slide 1)

✅ Key Capabilities:
	1.	Multi-dimensional Targeting & Progressive Rollouts
→ Gradually increase feature exposure based on user segments, geography, or risk profile
	2.	Set & Monitor Thresholds + Automated Rollbacks
→ Define latency/error limits; LaunchDarkly rolls back if violated
	3.	Error Monitoring Integration
→ Auto-detect regressions via performance metrics like latency, failure %, etc.

⸻

🛠️ Your Screenshot Flow Summary

🧪 Flag: togglebankDBGuardedRelease

Feature: Add or remove DynamoDB database
	•	✅ Guarded Rollout setup
	•	📊 Metrics monitored:
	•	Database Latency
	•	Database Error Rate
	•	🎯 Target: By user context
	•	🔁 Rollback: Automatic if regression is detected
	•	⏳ Rollout Duration: 24 hours (phased)

⸻

🌐 Flag: togglebankAPIGuardedRelease

Feature: API v2.0 release
	•	✅ Started as progressive rollout
	•	⛔ Rolled back at 50% exposure due to:
	•	API Latency spike (130ms+)
	•	API Error Rate = 0.60
	•	✅ Rollback to API v1.0 happened instantly

⸻

🧩 What You Can Explain in an Interview / POC

✅ Use Case: Real-time Production Safety

Let’s say you’re releasing a new payment API in your Spring Boot app:

if (launchDarklyClient.boolVariation("togglebankAPIGuardedRelease", user, false)) {
    return paymentService.v2().process(paymentRequest);
} else {
    return paymentService.v1().process(paymentRequest);
}

Now:
	•	You define API_LATENCY > 120ms or ERROR_RATE > 0.5 as regression thresholds
	•	LaunchDarkly detects this automatically
	•	Rollback happens without redeployment
	•	DevOps gets notified instantly, no downtime

⸻

💡 Summary: How Guarded Release + Progressive Rollout Work Together

Feature	What It Does
🎯 Targeting	Rollout to specific users/groups only
📈 Threshold Monitoring	Attach metrics like latency, error rates
🔁 Auto Rollback	Reverts to previous version if performance dips
⏳ Progressive rollout	Slowly increase traffic: e.g., 5% → 10% → 50%
🔒 Safe Deployment	Reduces blast radius, improves confidence
